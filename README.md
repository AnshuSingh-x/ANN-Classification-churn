# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This repository contains a deep learning classification model built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn or not. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers likely to leave and take proactive actions to retain them.

Features:
Binary classification using ANN (Churn: Yes/No)
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training with Keras/TensorFlow
Evaluation using accuracy
Easy to modify and expand

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
NumPy & Pandas 📊
Scikit-learn ⚙️
TensorFlow/Keras 🔧
TensorBoard 📈 (for visualization)

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
Customer ID
Geography
Gender
Age
Tenure
Balance
Products
Credit Score
Active/Inactive
Estimated Salary
Exited (Churn label)
